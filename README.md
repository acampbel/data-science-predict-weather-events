# Data Science: Predict Damage Costs of Weather Events
The goal of this case study is to explore storm events in various locations in the United States and analyze the frequency and damage costs associated with different types of events. A machine learning model is used to predict the damage costs, based on historical data from 1980 - 2020. The calculations are then performed in an app, which can be shared as a web application.

This example also highlights techniques for cleaning data in various forms (numeric, text, categorical, dates and times) and working with large data sets which do not fit into memory.

The example is used in the "Data Science with MATLAB" webinar series.
